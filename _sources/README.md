# Forecasting Bootcamp

This repository contains demos and reference implementations for a variety of forecasting techniques that will be highlighted at Vector Institute's upcoming Forecasting Using Deep Learning Bootcamp in March 2022.

## Accessing Data

During the bootcamp, all reference datasets are available on the Vector cluster at ```/ssd003/projects/forecasting_bootcamp/bootcamp_datasets/```

For external use, we are providing the following link for downloading datasets:

## Demos 
The demos for the bootcamp are available in the following directories:
- **intro_to_forecasting:** Two notebooks that overview the basics for time series analysis and time series forecasting. 
- **demos:** Outlines the application of Prophet, Neural Prophet, NBEATS, DeepAR and simple baseline methods to forecast exhange rates. The focus of these demos is to explore univariate forecasting. Lagged and/or future covariates are leveraged by methods that support them. Additionally, techniques for cross-validation are discussed. 
- **multivariate_demos:** Outlines the application of NBEATS and DeepAR to forecast hourly electricity consumption for a set of households based on past observations. The focus of this series of demos is to explore DeepAR and NBEATS in the multivariate forecasting setting. 
- **multivariate_lstf_demos:** Outlines the application of Autoformer and NHITS to forecasting a set of traffic sensors. The focus of these demos is too explore a multivariate time series forecasting problem where the desired input and ouput sequences are very large. 


## Main and dev branches

The AI Engineering team are using dev branches (e.g. [dev_demos](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/forecasting-bootcamp/tree/dev_demos)) to indicate works-in-progress. We invite you to view and begin experimenting with these resources, but please note that all material currently in development is subject to be modified, perhaps significantly, ahead of the bootcamp. 

## Environment 
In order to configure a Python 3.8 environment with the appropriate packages to run the demos, use the following sequence of commands on the command line:
- `conda create -n forecasting python=3.8`
- `conda activate forecasting`
- `conda install pip`
- `pip install -r forecasting_requirements.txt --user`

*NOTE*: If you are going to be using notebooks launched on our cluster, there is an issue with kernels associated with conda environments and cluster launched Jupyter notebooks. Thus, you should create an environment through `python3 -m venv` and source that in your slurm launch script or source from our prebuilt environment with `source /ssd003/projects/aieng/public/forecasting_unified/bin/activate`.
