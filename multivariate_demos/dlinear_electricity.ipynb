        "# Multivariate Forecasting with D-Linear\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook outlines the application of , a recently-proposed model for time series forecasting, to a Electricity Consumption Dataset. The dataset contains the hourly electricity consumption of 321 customers from 2012 to 2014.\n",

        "This demo uses an implementation of [D-Linear](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13504.pdf) from the Darts forecasting package. [Darts](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/index.html) is a package that provides a variety of time series forecasting methods for statistical models like [ARIMA](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.arima.html#darts.models.forecasting.arima.ARIMA), [Exponential Smoothing](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.exponential_smoothing.html#darts.models.forecasting.exponential_smoothing.ExponentialSmoothing) and [Prophet](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.prophet_model.html#darts.models.forecasting.prophet_model.Prophet) to [NBEATS](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.nbeats.html#darts.models.forecasting.nbeats.NBEATSModel) and [Temporal Fusion Transformer](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.tft_model.html#darts.models.forecasting.tft_model.TFTModel). On top of a diverse set of forecasting methods, Darts provides great utilities to process time series and evaluate forecasts."
